## Abstract

One long-standing assumption dominates economic voting research: that voters are retrospective and myopic. Recent research attempts to test this assumption to varying success. In the present article, I specify a new type of model that allows the economic vote to decay as voters' economic time frames increase. Consistent with voter myopia, I find that the economic vote is strongest where this time frame is shortest. The economic vote is strongest in the immediate present. After one and a half years, it falls by half. After five years, it is practically-equivalent to zero. This, I argue, shows that voters are less myopic than past research would have us believe. Still, there is some cause for concern: these time frames remain short enough that government might receive undeserved leeway for mistakes that they make early in their terms in office.
