## Abstract

Most economic voting research assumes that voters are retrospective and myopic. That is, they focus only on the recent past. Yet testing these assumptions is difficult and current approaches have serious shortcomings. To estimate voter's economic time frames, I specify a new model that borrows insights from the physical sciences. I show that voter myopia is real and that the economic vote is strongest when time frames are short. With a one and half year time frame, the effect falls by half. With a five year time frame, it becomes practically-equivalent to zero. This implies that voters are less myopic than past research would have us believe. Still, there is some cause for concern: voters' economic time frames are short enough that governments likely receive undue leeway for mistakes they make early in their tenure.
